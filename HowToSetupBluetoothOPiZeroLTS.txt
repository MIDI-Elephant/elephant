Enable uart1 on OPi via armbian-config:

System->Hardware->uart1

Reboot


This setup uses the HC-05 Bluetooth module.  It's connected to the OrangePi Zero LTS on UART1.  Pins:

HC-05	<---> OrangePi
Tx      <---> Pin 10, Uart1 Rx
Rx      <---> Pin 8, Uart1 Tx
Vcc     <---> Pin 5, +5v
Gnd	<---> Pin 25, Unused Gnd


After setting this up, The device needs to be configured for high speed
bluetooth communications via the AT mode. To do this, we will connect
to it on ttyS1 via the 'screen' program and configure it. Before connecting
the power to the board, hold down the button on the board and then connect
power. The LED should blink twice, pause 2 seconds, and blink twice again - continuously.

Now it's in AT command mode. Connect to it via screen:

screen /dev/ttyS1 38400

Type AT and press Ctrl-J - should see OK if it's working.  Then...

# Change name
AT+NAME=Elephant
# Change baud rate
AT+UART=115200,1,0
# Change password
AT+PSWD="0000"
Must type 'return' then 'ctrl-J' for the above to work

Supported baud rate: 9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,230400,460800

Just discovered two things: HC-05 module does not work with IOS because IOS only connects
with BLE 4.0 and above devices.

Max baud rate for Orange Pi Uart seems to be around 115200
